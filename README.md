# multi-echo-qsm

## Requirements
The following toolboxes are needed to run this code:
* MEDI toolbox: http://pre.weill.cornell.edu/mri/pages/qsm.html
* STI Suite: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~chunlei.liu/software.html
* Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image (optional, used for reading/writing NIfTI images): https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image
* Image Processing Toolbox for MATLAB (used for image resampling, which could also be performed using in-house code if needed)
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox for MATLAB (used for calculating normal distributions, which could also be calculated using in-house code if needed)
